Hi! I am a university student currently pursuing the study of Software Engineering. I have a passion for technology, problem-solving and exploring creative outlets.

Some of my repositories are private as they may contain projects for classes I am still taking. If you are a recruiter and want more information about those projects, please reach out to me.
